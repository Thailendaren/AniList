                    Victorique de Blois is so beautiful that when Kazuya Kujou first meets her he thinks she must be a doll. Victorique might look like a gothic lolita beauty, but she’s much rougher around the edges than she appears. She smokes a pipe, skips class, and solves crimes, none of which are fitting pastimes for a young lady in 1924 Europe.<br/><br/>

                    Kazuya is a Japanese student at the prestigious St. Marguerite Academy, located in the fictional French-speaking country of Sauville. Shunned by his classmates, who call him the Black Reaper, Kazuya finds solace in Victorique, who doesn’t seem to care who he is as long as he entertains her.<br/><br/>

                    Victorique spends her days at the Academy’s impressive library, where she whiles away the time reading books and solving mysteries that have the police baffled. With Kazuya by her side, the unlikely couple sets out to solve mysteries from the mundane to the supernatural. In Gosick, anything goes: murder, demonic dogs, and ghost ships are all fair game, as long as there’s a mystery to solve.<br/><br/>
